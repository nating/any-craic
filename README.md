# Any Craic?

An IoT application to determine whether a room is occupied, by using an LDR to determine whether the lights are on or not.

## Overview

This is a project to stop me from trekking to a room to chill out with people when there is in fact nobody in that room. When there is someone in the room, the lights are turned on. The light in the room can therefore be used as an indication of occupancy. By hooking up an LDR to a Raspberry Pi running a webserver, I can always tell whether there is someone in the room by connecting to the Pi.

Sometimes, there are meetings in this room. When there are meetings, the people occupying the room do not want to be disturbed. A button can be used in order for the people occupying the room to indicate that they do not want to be disturbed, as well as LEDs to indicate the current *"status"* of the device to those in the room.
